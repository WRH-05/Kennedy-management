## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Configuration Changes

1. **authService.js**: Email redirect URLs configured
```javascript
emailRedirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`
```

2. **CreateSchoolForm.tsx**: Redirects to check-email after creation
```javascript
router.push(`/auth/check-email?email=${encodeURIComponent(userData.email)}`)
```

3. **app/page.tsx**: Email confirmation checks enabled
```javascript
if (user && user.needsEmailConfirmation) {
  router.push(`/auth/check-email?email=${encodeURIComponent(user.email || '')}`)
  return
}
```

4. **AuthGuard.tsx**: Blocks unconfirmed users
```javascript
if (user.needsEmailConfirmation) {
  router.push(`/auth/check-email?email=${encodeURIComponent(user.email || '')}`)
  return
}
```

### Database Integration
- Supabase Auth handles email confirmation
- `email_confirmed_at` field tracks status
- Database triggers activate profiles post-confirmation
- RLS policies ensure security
